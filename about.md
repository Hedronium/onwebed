# About

Onwebed is a visual HTML editor, designed to keep HTML documents from getting messy. Since it doesn't use whitespaces, unlike most templating engines such as [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) or [Haml](http://haml.info/), there isn't a burden of escaping characters.

Onwebed is powered by Django, and is designed for creating dynamic and static websites. It features a simple concept of _boxes_ to craft HTML documents. Besides visual editing, there is a markup language for situations where visual editing may not be the most efficient - forming a hybrid system for developing pages.

> Every page in Onwebed is technically a Django template, thus Django's templating language is available to be used.

The concept of boxes is not limited to develop an HTML document but can be extended to do anything one desires. Boxes can be used to inherit other pages, override content, etc.
