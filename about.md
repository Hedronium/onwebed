# About

Onwebed is a [web template system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system) which lets you utilize the power of HTML in a visual way, without suffering from the drawbacks of a markup/templating language - such as messiness, burden of escaping white-spaces, redundancy, etc. It's inspired by templating engines such as [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) or [Haml](http://haml.info/).

Onwebed is powered by Django, and is designed for creating dynamic and static websites. It features a simple concept of _box_ to craft HTML documents. Besides visual editing, there is a markup language for situations where visual editing may not be the most efficient - forming a hybrid system for developing web pages.

> Every page in Onwebed is technically a Django template, thus Django's templating language is available to be used.

Boxes aren't limited to developing an HTML document, but can be extended to do anything one desires, such as - to inherit other pages, override content, etc.
