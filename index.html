</p><p>It doesn't settle with static pages, it's powerful enough to create fully-featured dynamic sites, housing a markup language, Django's templating engine, and lots more!
</p></div><div class="container mt-5" id="about-points"><h3>Simplicity</h3><p>Every single webpage you create with Onwebed is composed of "boxes."
</p><p>Boxes can be used to define your content, act as placeholders for reducing redundancy, house other boxs, or even include other pages.
</p><h3>Code HTML but Visually</h3><p>As mentioned in the previous heading, your webpages are built with what is known as "boxes." Each box may have a label attached to it.
</p><p>Let's look at few examples to understand the concept behind labels:
</p><ul><li>A box with label, "div" will be seen as a "div" element.
</li><li>A box with label, "div h1.title" will be seen as a "div" element with an "h1" element inside, having a class of "title".
</li><li>A box with label, "link[rel='stylesheet']." will be seen as a "link" element with an attribute "rel='stylesheet'." The fullstop resembles that the element won't have an ending tag.</li></ul><p>When your page is rendered, the boxes are basically going to be converted to HTML, labels define what the box is.

</p><h3>Extensible</h3><p>The concept of boxes lets you extend the features of Onwebed pretty easily. You can define your own type of boxes which can do whatever you program it to do.

</p><h3>It Got You Covered</h3><p>Ever thought of going back to plain old text-based editing? Onwebed has a built-in markup language to help you out when visual editing isn't the most efficient.
</p><h3>It's for Lazy People</h3><p>Ever made a section in your website which is included in multiple pages? That sounds like a dynamic website! Onwebed got your back on this.</p><p>Onwebed also lets you "prototype" other pages - that is, inherit its content but replace some of it dynamically (yes, any change you make to a page will be reflected to the other pages which inherit from it).
</p><p>At the end of the day, web development shouldn't be redundant, and Onwebed likes to keep it this way!
</p><h3>It's Not WYSIWYG</h3><p>WYSIWYG is cool, but it gets messy at times, it easy to lose control, and it can be limiting. For example, ever wanted to make a box inside another box, which is yet inside another box? Yes, it can get daunting in WYSIWYG! Onwebed is here to make life easier.
</p><h3>Powered by Django</h3><p>Yes, Onwebed is essentially a Django app. This is good news, it means that you have access to all of Django's features, that includes the templating engine!</p></div></div><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.15.6/highlight.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
